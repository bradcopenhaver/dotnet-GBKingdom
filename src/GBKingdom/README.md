# Gummi Bear Kingdom Site

Gummi Bear Kingdom is a fictional entity and is not intended to mimic or represent any real world entity or intellectual property. This site is a simple mockup ecommerce site with user-generated product reviews. It's basically a functional set of wireframes, because there are no images. Admin functions are shaded pink and would only be visible to site admins. 

The styling of the site was inspired by the [Free Style Ecommerce Bootstrap Web Template](https://w3layouts.com/preview/?l=/free-style-a-flat-ecommerce-bootstrap-responsive-web-template/).
